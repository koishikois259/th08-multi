# Download, install, and play on Linux

The native Linux reconstruction is the current playable release target. The
release includes the established 32-bit x86 product and a native-layout x86_64
product; an AArch64 build is available for hardware validation. Wine, Docker,
and the original `th08.exe` are not runtime requirements.

## What you need

- a Linux desktop with working OpenGL and audio;
- the runtime packages listed below;
- a legally obtained original Japanese TH08 1.00d data directory containing:
  - `th08.dat`
  - `thbgm.dat`

Those two DAT archives are the only copyrighted game files required by the
port. They are not included in the release. The selected data directory must
be writable because TH08 creates `th08.cfg`, `score.dat`, replays, screenshots,
backups, and diagnostic logs there.

## 1. Download the portable release

Open the [latest TH08 release](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th08/releases/latest)
and download the archive and matching `.sha256` file for your architecture:

| Host | Status | Archive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x86_64 / AMD64 | **Recommended; full-route tested** | `th08-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| i386 / 32-bit x86 | Compatibility build | `th08-modern-linux-i386.tar.gz` |
| AArch64 / ARM64 | **Experimental; real-hardware gameplay not yet verified** | `th08-portable-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` |

Most Intel and AMD Linux computers should use the x86_64 package. Check an
unfamiliar machine with `uname -m`; it normally prints `x86_64`, `i686`, or
`aarch64`. GitHub Actions artifacts are development snapshots, while Release
assets are the stable player download.

## 2. Install the runtime libraries

On an x86_64 Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or compatible system, install:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
  libstdc++6 libgl1 libfontconfig1 \
  libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 \
  fonts-vlgothic
```

The i386 compatibility package needs the corresponding 32-bit libraries:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
  libstdc++6:i386 libgl1:i386 libfontconfig1:i386 \
  libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 libsdl2-image-2.0-0:i386 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0:i386 \
  fonts-vlgothic
```

On a native AArch64 Debian-family system, install the same unqualified package
names as x86_64. Other distributions need equivalent native packages for the
C++ runtime, OpenGL, Fontconfig, SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_ttf, plus a Japanese
font. The launcher itself never invokes `sudo`.

## 3. Verify and extract the package

For the recommended x86_64 package, run these commands in the directory
containing the two downloaded files:

```bash
sha256sum -c th08-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256
tar -xzf th08-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd th08-portable-linux-x86_64
```

For i386 or AArch64, substitute the exact archive and checksum names from the
table above. Do not continue if the checksum command reports a mismatch.

## 4. Start TH08

Pass the directory containing your original DAT archives:

```bash
./run-th08.sh "/path/to/original/TH08 directory"
```

For example, if the extracted package is a child of the data directory:

```text
TH08/
├── th08.dat
├── thbgm.dat
└── th08-portable-linux-x86_64/
```

start it from inside the package with:

```bash
./run-th08.sh ..
```

The path is resolved at launch and is never hard-coded into the executable.
Spaces and non-ASCII characters are supported when the path is quoted.

## First launch

With only the two DAT files present, the game creates its configuration, score,
backup directory, and logs automatically. An existing `th08.cfg` is optional.
On a low-resource VM without 3D acceleration, the first fullscreen FPS/vsync
calibration can be slow and may temporarily look stalled.

The empty-backup startup path is covered by a regression test: the Linux Win32
compatibility layer now rejects an invalid file-search handle harmlessly,
creates the first score backup, and continues into the title and stage assets.

## Build and run from a source checkout

On Debian or Ubuntu, the one-command developer path installs missing build
dependencies, builds the native i386 executable, and launches it:

```bash
scripts/setup-modern-linux.sh "/path/to/original/TH08 directory"
```

After the initial setup, use the incremental path:

```bash
scripts/play-modern-linux.sh "/path/to/original/TH08 directory"
```

Docker is available only as an optional reproducible build environment; it is
not required to run the resulting game. See [Native Linux playable
reconstruction](LINUX_PORTING.md) for backend architecture, build isolation,
validation coverage, and porting lessons.

## Troubleshooting

Run the launcher from a terminal so early errors remain visible:

```bash
./run-th08.sh "/path/to/original/TH08 directory"
echo $?
```

Check the executable and unresolved runtime libraries with:

```bash
file ./th08-modern
ldd ./th08-modern | grep "not found"
```

Runtime diagnostics are written inside the selected data directory:

- `log.txt`: normal game log;
- `modern-files.txt`: files requested during the current run;
- `modern-crash.txt`: symbolizable fatal-signal report;
- `backup/modern-crash.txt`: possible early-startup report while score backups
  are being rotated.

If the program exits unexpectedly, preserve those files and report the exit
code, distribution, desktop session, GPU/OpenGL environment, and the exact
launch command. Do not upload the DAT archives, original executable, score
files, or replays unless they are specifically needed and safe to share.

## Current limitations

- MIDI output is a compatibility stub; the normal WAV BGM path is validated.
- Keyboard input is validated; controller compatibility is not yet a release
  target.
- AArch64 has build and emulated-loader coverage; gameplay validation on a real
  AArch64 desktop remains pending.
- Stage 4-to-5 dynamic-text tiling and missing enemy/boss art were observed in
  earlier bring-up builds, but were not reproduced in the final x86_64
  full-route and Practice passes. Preserve diagnostics if either regression
  returns on another driver or desktop.
